# Good looking Todo App with DJANGO and VANILLA JAVASCRIPT

## An easy todo app with backend that makes possible to automatically save your todo list on the server

This app's front end was created by the awsome [developedbyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ)'s YouTube tutorial, and I decided to give a backend to it. So now users can register, and save their todo lists on the django server. The current functions of the app:

* Register a user account (currently without email)
* Add as many todos as you want
* Mark todos as done
* Filter the added todos
* Everything is automatically saved to the server
